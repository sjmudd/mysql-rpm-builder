This page is to list issues seen so far
=======================================

The BuildRequires settings are incomplete which can lead to the build
almost completing but failing when verifying all required built files
are present.

Below I indicate some of the issues seen which are still pending
resolution.

8.0.26 / CentOS 8
-----------------

Current config, build almost completes but fails with this:

...

RPM build errors:
    File not found: /home/rpmbuild/rpmbuild/BUILDROOT/mysql-community-8.0.26-1.el8.x86_64/usr/lib64/mysql/plugin/debug/authentication_ldap_sasl_client.so

- Looks like I'm not providing appropriate options to build these files.
- Docs imply they should be built on community servers
- there's already a sasl-devel rpm installed
- adding krb5-devel doesn't seem to be enough
- conclusion: missing rpmbuild options to trigger this and probably installing some packages required for the build.
